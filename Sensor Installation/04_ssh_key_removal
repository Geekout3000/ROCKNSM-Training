##Required to ssh into sensor
####Because our boxes are now "remote" (on the table), we need to ensure that we can successfully ssh into the sensor


cd .ssh/
ll (to find known_hosts)
vi known_hosts
Look for 172.16.100.100
Delete 172.16.100.100 fingerprint line (starting at .100 and ending at =)
Save config wq
Check connection by ssh to 172.16.100.100
Should prompt to create new fingerprint, type yes

Move to step 5 repositories in Command folder
