### Configure repo:
Locally on the student44 box navigate to: cd /etc/yum.repos.d
do a "ll" to display the perched.repo
sudo vi perched.repo
curl 192.168.2.208:8008  (verify that repos are present)

In sensor:  cd /etc/yum.repos.d
ll (to list all the current repos)
Remove all the current repos: "sudo rm -f *"

Go back to student44 and scp the perched.repo file to sensor
    "scp /etc/yum.repos.d/perched.repo sg10:~"

Go back to sensor and move the file to the correct folder
    Right now the file is in home, move it to yum.repo.d
      "sudo mv perched.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/"
      verify by navigating and running ll
Install tcpdump:  sudo yum install tcpdump
Run command in sensor:  sudo tcpdump -i enp2s0  (We should have traffic)

## Installing Stenographer
    1. ssh into sensor
    2. sudo yum install stenographer
    3. cd /etc/stenographer
    4. ll
    5. sudo vi config (make changes to the below option)
        * PacketsDirectory should be changed to "/data/stenographer/packets"
        * IndexDirectory changed to "/data/stenographer/index"
        * Interface changed "enp2s0" (stenographer listens on this int)
        * Port changed to "8086"
        * Host changed to "172.16.100.100"
        * wq
    6. sudo stenokeys.sh stenographer stenographer  (creating keys for the group and user stenographer)
        * should get back generating key/cert for client, server, and ca
    7. sudo mkdir -p /data/stenographer/{packets,index}
    8. sudo chown -R stenographer:stenographer /data/stenographer
    9. $ `sudo systemctl start stenographer`
    10. $ `sudo systemctl status stenographer`
### Stenographer Validation
    1. $ `cd /data/stenographer/packets`
            * after a few seconds, list out and you should see a random string of numbers with stenographer stenographer as the user and group

End of task, move to step 6 install Suricata: 06Config.md

    gpgcheck=0
sudo yum makecache fast
yum search atom (just to confirm installation)

Set up repo:

sudo rsync -r admin@192.168.2.11:/data/share/repos . --progress
