### The following commands will be run by instructor to validate ROCKNSM
### installation on test day:

curl 172.16.100.100:9200/_cat/indices
sudo tcpdump -i enp2s0
sudo systemctl stop suricata
sudo systemctl stop stenographer
sudo systemctl stop fsf
sudo systemctl stop filebeat
sudo systemctl stop zookeeper
sudo systemctl stop kafka
sudo systemctl stop logstash
sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch
sudo systemctl stop kibana
sudo broctl stop
        stopping worker-1-1 ...
        stopping worker-1-2 ...
        stopping proxy-1 ...
        stopping manager ...
        manager crashed during shutdown  (this is OK)

### Suricata validation

ls /data/suricata/logs
sudo rm -rf /data/suricata/logs/*    (eve.json file is deleted)
sudo systemctl start suricata
ls /data/suricata/logs    (eve.json file is back)

### stenographer Validation

sudo rm -rf /data/stenographer/*
sudo systemctl start stenographer
ls /data/stenographer
ls /data/stenographer/packets
cd /data/stenographer

### Bro Validation

broctl start
cd /data/bro/logs/current/
ls  (to check presence of conn.log)

### Zookeeper and Kafka

sudo systemctl stop zookeeper
sudo systemctl stop kafka
sudo rm -rf /data/kafka/logs/*
sudo rmr -rf /var/lib/zookeeper/version-2/
sudo systemctl start zookeeper
sudo systemctl start kafka
give it a few seconds
cd /data/kafka/logs/
ls > should expect to see bro-raw-0 (this means bro is talking to kafka)

### Filebeat Validation

cd /data/kafka/logs/
sudo systemctl start filebeat
give it a few seconds
ls
  should now see the suricata-raw-0 file

(If you don't see this, check vi /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml; if that is correct, check kafka)


### FSF Validation
cd /data/fsf/logs
em rockout.log
sudo systemctl start fsf
/opt/fsf/fsf-client//fsf_client.py --full daemon.log  (tab out after full and grab any file)
    should get a json file return
now do an ll and you will have your rockout.log back

In cd /data/kafka/logs >>>> should now have fsf-raw-0

### Elasticsearch

sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
curl 172.16.100.100:9200
   once you get the output, you know elasticsearch is working

### Logstash Validation

sudo systemctl sstart logstash
curl 172.16.100.100:9200/_cat/indices
    you are looking for the 4th number to the last, this number should be going up each time you run the curl commands
      typically suricata will increase

### Kibana Validation

sudo systemctl start kibana
go the Webpage 172.16.100.100:5601
    if you can get to the page, then success
another check is on the kibana GUI >> Management >> index patterns >> type: bro-* >> Next >> select @timestamp >> create >>> refresh and view the log on the left or above
        do for suricata-* and fsf-*


cd /var/log
ll
  all the installed tools should be there (suricata, filebeat, logstash
  , etc. Each one of them should have a log)
cd Zookeeper
ll
cat zookeeper.log (this should show any error issues for more troubleshooting)

do this for each of the files to determine if any errors or warnings, for example:
    cat /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log | grep ERROR

Some other troubleshooting concepts is to ensure the tool owns the file. check the permissions and change if necessary
